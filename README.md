## Project description
The visual word form area in the occipitotemporal sulcus, here referred to as OTS-words, responds more strongly to text than other visual stimuli and plays a critical role in reading. Here we hypothesized, that this region’s preference for text may be driven by a preference for reading tasks, as in most prior fMRI studies only the text stimuli were readable. To test this, we performed three fMRI experiments (N=15) and systematically varied the participant’s task and the visual stimulus, investigating mOTS-words and pOTS-words subregions. 
### Experiments
We ran 3 fMRI experiments on 15 subjects:<br />
Exp 1: Localizer : Five visual categories were presented while adult subjects performed a 1-back task, images were either colored or in grayscale.<br />
Exp 2:  fMRI adaptation : 2 pairs of images were presented, whereas each pair formed an English compound word; participants had to indicate when the image was white. All images in a trial were either in emoji, text, or mixed format. Pairs in a trial could be repeated or non-repeated.<br />
Exp 3: Reading vs. color judgment: Subjects performed a reading or a color judgment task on compound words, formed either from text or emoji stimuli.<br />
